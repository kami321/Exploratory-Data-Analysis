## Introduction of the Data

Flight delays might cause a lot of inconvenience. Customers would not want to waste precious vocation or work time by waiting for hours at a busy airport. That is the purpose for this exploratory data analysis on this United Airlines (carrier code UA) dataset. The main focus is to improve both efficiency and customer satisfaction.

In this study, I would find out what causes departure/arrival delays. Are delays growing better or worse with different time of the day? Is there a relationship between departure delays and the time of year? Does the visibility, wind speed, weather temperature, and precipitation affect airplane ability to arrive on time?
